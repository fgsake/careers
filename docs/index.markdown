Our team conducts large-scale research in partnership with Indiana University researchers and then spreads those findings through evocative & engaging content that measurably improves users' lives. OMGYES lets people dispel myths, see through the taboos and get to know and love themselves as they truly are.

### ** <u> Head of Content Design</u> **

We’re looking for a highly experienced editorial leader or content design leader to join our company leadership team as **Head of Content Design.**

Your team will include copywriters, visual designers, a product manager, engineers, researchers, illustrators, animators, a producer, and a film production and post production team. Your job will be to lead them in a pretty fascinating process:

1. We choose specific taboo parts of life that haven’t been adequately researched, and that people currently go through alone without the benefit of collective wisdom.

2. Within that taboo part of life, we do interviews and surveys to gather the collective insights of thousands of people. We distill those results to identify what positive benefits are possible, what knowledge and experiences lead to those benefits, and what hurdles get in the way for people.
 
3. Then we package that raw knowledge and wisdom into engaging, eye-opening web content, usually including text, storytelling videos, statistics, visuals and anything else you can think of that will transmit the knowledge to users for maximum impact.

#### **What you'll do**

* Use your editorial judgment, psychological sensitivity and creativity to curate, package and craft content from the research insights

* Build and deepen your understanding of how users react by watching user interviews. Stay constantly grounded to the imagined user and what they'd think and feel in reaction to each bit of content

* Coach the team to constantly develop ways of framing, naming, organizing and presenting content so that users will feel inspired, so that the ideas feel fresh and important and worth really laking in. You want the user to question the completeness of their existing knowledge and look for a pen to take notes

* Create pipelines, rubrics and systems so the team can scale and work on several topics in parallel

* Define talent gaps, write job descriptions, hire and manage creative team members and contractors, providing guidance and mentorship, and overseeing their professional growth and development

### ** <u>RESEARCH SCIENTIST</u> **

This is an opportunity to work in an environment where research forms the basis of the entire company. We are looking for multiple types of researchers to join us in conducting company-funded (that’s right, NO grant writing required) qualitative and quantitative studies and publishing papers about specific sexual pleasure and flourishing strategies that have never been explored before. You might be one of these people: 

* A social scientist who would be lit up by investigating associations between specific pleasure techniques and populations’ flourishing outcomes. You’ll be designing and analyzing large scale qualitative and quantitative data from nationally representative, cross-sectional surveys.

* Or a measure-creation scientist. You’ll be involved in creating measures (developing scale items and conducting psychometric analyses) in important areas that have been historically neglected by researchers (e.g. new measures focusing on maladaptive and healthy beliefs about pleasure). 

* Or a longitudinal researcher excited by conducting efficacy studies. You’ll design research that evaluates the impact of OMGyes.com as a sexual empowerment/knowledge resource for different populations (e.g. college students…) and that explores the extent to which growth of sexual self-knowledge, pleasure, agency and confidence lead to enhanced health and wellness outcomes over time. We measure the significant positive psychological impact OMGYES has on its users. And those effects are what we design for and optimize for, not things like daily active users or time on site. The more people's lives improve from the product experience, the more people recommend us and the more our business continues to take off. It's a virtuous cycle that's a joy to be a part of. The right candidate has:

* A doctoral degree (Phd, ScD) in a social science discipline like sociology, psychology, or public health 

* Published extensively and loves the process: from hypothesis development to study design to literature reviews to writing, submitting, and revising peer-reviewed manuscripts. 

* A belief in open-access journals and that the public should be able to decipher and benefit from published research (not just clinicians and other scientists.) We emphasize open access publishing. 

* Expertise in the type of methods they are excited to work with as described under each type of researcher above: mixed methods study design, survey-creation, psychometric measure creation, quantitative analysis, longitudinal study/efficacy trial design, thematic analysis. 

* Experience using happiness/wellbeing and flourishing/pleasure measures, not just measures of health issues and coping behaviors. 

* Self-directed ability to design and conduct research on a fast-paced schedule.

We’d love to hear from you if:

You’re a builder. The idea of being able to create your own department without bureaucracy gets your imagination rolling

You know from experience that your team is most productive when they feel rested, trusted and valued.

You want to have impact. You’d feel energized getting messages from users around the world telling you how your product made them realize they’re not alone and gave them new confidence.

You value user research so much that you’d like to help run a company that’s rooted in it. You love the art and science of making hypotheses to test. And you even like when your hypotheses are proven wrong because it brings you closer to the truth.

You love to apply creativity to process problems, cutting to the core of them, identifying what needs to be done, and making it happen through communication, delegation, and ingenuity.

If you don’t see a job listed for you, let us know what you would be interested in here.

So what’s it like working at OMGYES?

Here are some words from a few team members:

ERIN KÖKDIL
Post Production Supervisor

"When I began working at FGS, I didn’t realize how impactful the work would be on my own life."

MIKAYLA MCVEY
Senior Producer

"I’m thrilled to have colleagues who I genuinely adore, and who share a passion for vulnerable human storytelling."

ROB PERKINS
Co-Founder

"I love how when this team gets together, we each get more confident and more audacious about what we imagine is possible"

Some Faqs
What is the elevator pitch?

OMGYES is a research company and website dedicated to replacing taboo and misinformation about sexual pleasure with healthy, honest truths, based on the lived experiences of tens of thousands of women.

Why should an A-player join OMGYES?

We offer big company stability (profitable and growing for 5 years in a row) and competitive compensation with a small company sense of community and lack of bureaucracy.

It’s a company that’s really blazing a trail in an important part of life that’s been historically neglected not just by companies but in culture. And we’ve got the vision, scientific rigor and psychological sensitivity to make significant cultural change with a product people embrace and pay for, in the mainstream.

Business-wise, we’ve grown quickly without yet having internal marketing, product or product design teams. So there’s a lot of room to have a big impact and build systems, processes and capabilities. We will give you room and support so you can do your best work.

This is a mission-driven company and product that’s actually focused on improving lives, first and foremost. We optimize for impact in vital parts of people’s lives: things like knowing what you like, knowing it’s normal and ok and advocating for it. It’s a virtuous cycle - the more positive impact our product has, the more people recommend us.

Did OMGYES have investors?

Yes, we had a series A of $4.6M from angel investors before we launched in December 2015. We generate enough revenue to fuel our growth, so no further funding rounds are planned.

What’s the founding story of OMGYES?

It all started with a group of friends having open conversations about sex. A few times, they shared the specific, detailed ways of touching that made their pleasure better, solo and with partners. Everyone in the group really valued those discussions - and remarked how hearing one another share without blushing or shame made us all feel like we could be open about it, too. And the group realized there were patterns to what felt good; it wasn’t true that ‘everyone’s completely different.’ Different people in the group had independently stumbled upon similar discoveries, but they’d never heard anyone talk about them before.

They did some research and found that the specifics of what’s sexually pleasurable actually hadn’t been studied because the taboos stretched even into science/academia. So they asked researchers at Indiana University and The Kinsey Institute, what would it take to do that research? Could we make that happen? And the project began.

Thousands volunteered to participate, be interviewed and appear in videos on the site. So the friends gathered a team, partnered with Indiana University and Kinsey Institute researchers, and interviewed 1000 women, asking what they’d discovered that they wish they’d known sooner that made their pleasure better. Then they did the analysis to find the patterns and conducted and published the first-ever large-scale nationally representative study on women’s specific pleasure discoveries and techniques.

In parallel, the team did extensive research on how best to present the information so it would have a maximum positive impact and reach. That research led to three main insights:

1. Ultra-Honest Videos: Hearing individuals open up about these discoveries was most powerful (like in the initial conversations that inspired the project.) When you see someone be vulnerable and share this stuff, it gets processed and retained differently - almost like something a good friend told you, not like something you merely read about online.

2. New Vocabulary: Many of the techniques and insights from the research hadn’t even been named before. And the research showed that having descriptive, comfortable words to talk about, communicate with and guide partners around these techniques was highly impactful

3. Actually Seeing: And they found that actually seeing the techniques, in line-art animation or in the actual video, made them stick in the user’s mind and actually be implemented in real life.

So, they turned the study findings into OMGYES.com, where the techniques from the interviews and large-scale research findings are brought to life in these ways, which measurably improve users’ lives.

What’s the company culture like?

The strongest element of company culture is the shared cause - we’re passionate about meaningfully improving lives in a really fundamental way. We get notes from users that make us tear up every week.

Our team is deeply collaborative, supportive, and friendly. Coworkers enjoy one another– we laugh a lot, and we care about each other’s lives outside the office. We’re interested in each other’s individual growth and success as well as the company’s growth and success, and we make it a priority to celebrate work and life milestones with each other (recently: a new baby, buying a house, releasing a film side-project.)

We work hard to foster an environment of open communication, empathy, inclusion, and equity. We strive to stay humble and curious, open to new and better approaches to the work, to the company culture, and to ways we interact.

We believe strongly in healthy work/life balance. We discourage work on nights and weekends, we each have 4-weeks of paid vacation + sick leave + mental health days. We believe in growth and learning paths through assessment, goal-setting and company-paid training so employees can evolve and strengthen their abilities.

How has Covid impacted the business?

On the business side, we were fortunate to have a huge spike in new users after lockdowns began as demand increased for learning things online and ways to ‘explore the great indoors.’

Certainly, though, it’s been psychologically tough for everyone. We’ve gradually adapted to zoom but miss the camaraderie of spending time together. To support our employees and contractors in this time, we’ve had get-togethers, from sharing during tough times to parties celebrating our successes. We’ve also given periodic ‘Goodness’ stipends, which are $2000 budgets, half of which are for employees to spend on their own wellness, and half to give away to anyone or any org in their community.

What does hiring look like overall for 2021?

This is a big growth year, as we are aiming to effectively double the number of our full-time employees. We are working carefully with strategic consultants to help us make this transition thoughtfully. 

What is the vision for growth?

The plan is to scale our model of conducting large-scale, bottom-up research and turning the insights into practical, radically-open resources.

• Leverage research, thought-leadership and PR to make this movement mainstream

• Research demonstrating that knowing what you like and how to ask for it is a central part of wellness

• Expand into other vital but understudied areas of human experience


How international is OMGYES?

OMGYES has been translated by local domain expert translators and editors into 12 languages. More than 65% of users are outside the US. The issues our research addresses are universal human issues.

Where can I read your peer-reviewed publications?

Our research science team publishes the findings underlying OMGYES. You can read a few here:

Women's Experiences With Genital Touching, Sexual Pleasure, and Orgasm: Results From a U.S. Probability Sample of Women Ages 18 to 94

Women’s techniques for making vaginal penetration more pleasurable: Results from a nationally representative study of adult women in the United States

How are you working during Covid?

We have all been working remotely from home during COVID-19 but look forward to eventually returning in person to our office in Berkeley, California. If there’s a great fit, we’re open to flexible work from home, fully remote work with occasional travel to work at the office alongside the team, and/or relocation assistance.

What’s the Berkeley office like?

We love it! It’s a 4,000 sq foot office in Berkeley, CA. It’s airy with plenty of space, meeting rooms and living-room-like gathering areas.

What are salary and benefits like?

OMGYES positions offer a competitive salary, a healthy work/life balance, and a great benefits package, including health, dental, vision, life, and gym.
